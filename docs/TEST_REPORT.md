## 🚀 User Testing Instructions

### Quick Start
1. Open terminal and navigate to project directory
2. Run `npm run dev` (server starts on port 3000)
3. Open browser to `http://localhost:3000`
4. You'll see the Advisory Neural Board interface

### Testing the Insurance Data
1. Locate `insurance.csv` in the project root
2. Drag and drop the file into the upload zone
3. Watch the neural board animate through the analysis
4. Observe the AI thinking process and node activations
5. The simulation completes in ~20 seconds

### Expected Behavior
- File upload triggers "uploading" state
- Neural nodes light up in sequence
- AI thoughts appear as animated bubbles
- Progress bar shows analysis completion
- Status updates from "waiting" → "uploading" → "analyzing" → "complete"
